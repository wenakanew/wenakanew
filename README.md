# Wenaka — A Curated Repository

By candlelight and careful craft, welcome to Wenaka — a small, deliberate collection of code, curiosities, and quiet experiments. This repository is the author's public atelier: ideas dressed in logic, finished with a flourish.

> "Things of value are made slowly and kept with care."

What this is

- A personal repository that houses projects, notes, and crafted pieces of software.
- A showcase of aesthetic coding: thoughtful, intentional, and a little old-world in spirit.
- A quiet place for experiments that prefer form as much as function.

Why this feel?

This README wears a vintage coat because the work inside respects craft. Expect considered defaults, modest dependencies, and well-lit design choices — the kind you'd keep on a shelf rather than toss in a drawer.

Getting started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wenakanew/wenakanew.git
cd wenakanew

# Inspect the contents
ls -la
```

If a particular project in this collection needs more setup, you'll find a README inside its folder with precise instructions — each room has its own map.

Contributing

If you'd like to add a piece, fix a stain, or polish a corner:

1. Fork the repo and create a branch with a clear name: `feature/your-thing` or `fix/what-you-found`.
2. Make your edits with care and write a short note in your commit about the why.
3. Open a pull request and include context — a line or two is enough.

We value thoughtful contributions; patches that arrive with clear intent and provenance are welcomed with gratitude.

Style & Philosophy

- Minimalism with intent: prefer fewer, better choices.
- Legibility over cleverness.
- Backward-looking elegance: modern tools, timeless taste.

A final note
