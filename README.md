## About

I’m a Computer Science student at **Zetech University** with a deep interest in building **useful, durable, and intelligent software**.

My work sits at the intersection of **web engineering, AI systems, and applied problem-solving**. I enjoy designing systems that feel simple on the surface but are thoughtfully engineered underneath — whether that’s a full-stack platform, an AI agent, or a robotics project.

I value:
- clarity over complexity  
- reliability over hype  
- solutions that actually ship

## Philosophy

> “Good software is quiet.  
> It does its job, doesn’t beg for attention,  
> and keeps working long after the hype fades.”

I’m interested in roles, collaborations, and ideas that value **engineering depth**, **long-term thinking**, and **real-world impact**.
